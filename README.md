# Ebiten Pong

A very simple Pong clone written using Go and the [Ebiten](https://ebiten.org/) 2D game library. There's really nothing
fancy here, I just wanted to explore this library. Implements very simple collision detection, and a very basic physics 
system. Its pong, not the greatest version, but Pong, none-the-less.

## Installation
1. Clone this repo into your $GOPATH
2. In the project directory, run `go build`
3. `./ebiten-pong`
